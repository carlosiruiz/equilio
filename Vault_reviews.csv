As a woman, If you are choosing between a big consulting firm they all have their advantages and disadvantages. As a Partner/Executive Accenture stands out for these reasons:
1) Diversity representation at leadership levels is impressive (and that includes the Energy/Resources sector in consulting!)
2) Accenture is not tied to the Audit restrictions of the Big 4 firms - this is not to be underestimated. It makes doing your job much easier (and your family is grateful too as they are not restricted in how they investment in the same way).
3) Given the pace of digital change, Accenture is great place to future proof your skills (it's easy to learn about new technologies inc RPA/AI/Design thinking methods etc)

Accenture is a huge company that does just about anything someone could want to do in IT. The difficult part is finding the right client at the right time to be able to align what you want in your career with what the company needs to get completed.

Much is luck. Looking for projects on your own in a 400,000 plus employee company means stiff competition after getting hired. Each project ends leaving the employee in the same vulnerable position of a job seeker. Time on the bench is counted as mostly unproductive since you are not billable. One can shine only while they are billable. So its like being a freelancer while being employed in a company. There is little help and structure when it comes to finding projects. The systems don't work the way as they are designed and its much more organic and in Brownian motion that in should be in my experience.

Between the team lead, deputy team lead and analysts we had 6 years of total work experience combined. During my time at Accenture I found that many managers had zero supervisory or management skills prior to being promoted and the promotion was given purely based on senority since the best employees were leaving the company. Managers treated team members like children, listening in to our phone calls, looking over our shoulders as we worked on PowerPoints or other products.

Like others have said here, Accenture allows retaliatory behavior from senior people.

Do not even go for Accenture, if you have any other offer in hand go for that. I was having multiple offer in hand and I made mistake waiting for Accenture after clearing all interviews. But, not a single reply from Accenture even after clearing everything.
I have been interviewed for Managerial Position for Python. After successfully clearing the technical round, there was no response from Accenture. Afterwords, I got a mail from HR saying, I have successfully cleared all rounds and they are considering me for the current open position. They filled my EAF, took all the documents.
After this, I waited for almost 4 months (I got mail from HR on 2nd Dec 2015) but I didnt got any response from Accenture. I have mailed HR many times but not a single time the HR responded. They didnt have even that courtesy to tell selected candidate if they kept pending, or position cancelled or anything else.
I have left another offer in my hand considering Accenture but I lost everything and it kept me jobless. Its very bad. HRs should go and learn the basics of HR if they do such things with new employees. They should know that their such careless thing can make someone jobless.
Atleast show courtesy in mailing and letting know update for the position and offer for the selected candidates.
Accenture has a big name but if they will keep doing such things, their name will not be taken in good companies.
I can say from my experience is, if you get another opportunity go for that. Dont go for Accenture even if you get selected in all rounds. Dont spoil your career and be jobless by trusting Accenture.

I would recommend another firm over joining Accenture, particularly for those coming out of an MBA program. Accenture seems to place a higher value on those that joined out of undergrad and stay with the company, rather than those who hold an MBA. The culture does not integrate MBAs well, but rather it feels like they anticipate most will leave after 2 years and therefore do not invest in training and mentorship.

I was hired under false pretenses, led to believe during my interviews that I was being hired to initially build a QA program from the ground up, and I would take full ownership & management responsibility as the QA team grew. Once I went through orientation (3 weeks after starting on the project at the client site), I discovered that the internal career level I had been hired at was several levels below that which was required in order to supervise or manage others & that I would have to remain in my current & subsequent career levels a minimum of 1 year each before the possibility of advancement to the next level was considered. When I raised this concern with management, including the manager who interviewed me & informed me that I would own & manage the QA team as it grew, I was told that I should have negotiated my starting career level prior to accepting the job offer, even though I had no way of knowing the internal career level system or specifics prior to my orientation session.

It's all about what you make of it; prepare yourself by deeply researching the particular area (function; industry) where you want to work and be very assertive in positioning yourself to get in that space as soon as you begin work there.

Otherwise, it is ""luck"" that would position you to progress rapidly and gain outstanding project exposure.

Accenture's brand is highly recognized and respected globally, and it's a great place to start a career and build a customer-service oriented consulting mindset and problem solving skills that can be applied throughout your career. Additionally, the structured career progression model provides assurance that your market value will continue to increase at a predictable and rapid pace. Personalities that are motivated by unstructured problems and embrace organic role descriptions tend to enjoy the career and do well. Those that have a more specific expectation on the structure of their work (types of projects and scope of roles, etc.) tend to not fit well. Assessing where you see yourself in that regard should be a key factor in evaluating a career in consulting, with Accenture or similar firms. In evaluating Accenture against other consultancies Accenture differentiates most on having a strong culture and a highly respected brand, particularly among the larger firms that provide a broad mix of management consulting, technology and outsourcing services.","Los Angeles, CA2013",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

The hours are extremely trying, and although we get very good Paid Time Off (PTO) it is very hard to take without managers or higher level individuals giving you a hard time.

I also went almost two years without any sort of raise because of the ""financial crisis"" when the company itself was continuing to perform very well. However, they recently made up for this by giving me two significant raises within less than two months.

Indian integrators are a good place for 2 types of resources: 1) Strong technical types who simply want the pay and travel benefits of consulting without the social politics that usually come along with it 2) Minority resources who have the skills and experience for mid to senior leadership roles but are being deined in the traditional firms (e.g. Accenture, IBM, Bain, etc) due to the social, policitical, and cultural discrimination that exist in those places.
As long as someone falls in these categories, is willing to accept the ""wilderness experience"" that comes with working at an Indian integrator and has an overall career plan this like the other Indian firms could be a positive place to work.",,"

Best Aspects: The job, working directly with clients, is challenging but an absolute delight. Some of these clients are world leaders and trend setters in their domain. And for them to consult us for their decision making and process improvements is a self gratifying feeling.
Worst Aspects: There is minimal visiblity on how promotions and year end appraisals are carried out in Cognizant Business Consulting. The actual criterian for appriasals is in contrast to what is officially published by the company. You barely see your direct supervisors taking an interest in your project or career. Although the company has a year end discussion process. But that process is more of a 'breifing' on ratings from the supervisor to the subordinate rather than a discussion on the strengths, weaknesses, achievements or rationale. Some are given managers designations because of their excellent functional knowledge, but appear to lack a great deal of skill managing people.
A lot of emphasis is laid on how to acquire new talent; but minimal is done to retain the existing talent pool of consultants.",2013,VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Company itself only gives 20 days vacation per year and on top of it, management don't approve the days off. Forget holidays.
If you are IT from E.U. most likely you'll be assigned to bug fixing or application support so if you want to learn new technologies and progress in your career, Cognizant is definitely not the place for you. You'll be treated as a number not a person.
You will most likely end up alone in a project with 10 other Indian people fixing bugs, so if you expect European co-workers that's again not the right company for you.
Management several times convince people to work everyday (Saturdays, Sundays inclusive) and many days past midnight. Be careful about abusive Management.

When you are hired in as salary you become a slave. They expect you to be on call everyday, at any time of day. You don't even get a break when you are supposed to be on vacation. They will have you on conference calls from, literally, half way around the world.
The organizational structure is inconsistent. Some areas have specific levels while others have people at all levels doing the same work. And even though you have an official boss, that likely isn't the only person that will be giving you directions. Work priorities are handed out from people that aren't even in your same division, let alone your department.
The notion of too many chiefs and not enough indians has a different twist within GM. There are not enough workers to get everything done, thus being on call 24/7. So the managers have to do the work that they don't have enough people to cover. Then they can't do their jobs of actually managing their teams. Or even taking enough time for interviews when they get approval to hire more people.
","
If you are serious about coming into GM, reconsider. This isn't the company it used to be. I was told by my boss that I was going to be brought in (from a contract position of over 10 years), despite not being the best person for the job and HR rejecting me since I don't fit. You will be forced to do work that you shouldn't be doing.
For the amount of hours you will be working you would make more money as a contract employee. The benefits are just the same, or worse than contract houses. There is no more pension, just a 401(k) like most other full time jobs. You get no sick time, officially.
And with all the talk about how GM is doing better with the new management, it isn't. The mindset hasn't changed. In one forced training class another employee (of over 20 years) told me it was the third time he had to take the class, they had just changed the name. The material was all the same. And a lot of it was actually incorrect, showing the wrong way decisions are still being made.",February 2015,CURRENT EMPLOYEE

You never can speak to a live person from your personal site from HR by phone. Which is horrible if you have an urgent need.

When you just want to speak with someone who knows what'sgoing on and will resolve. Another with being hired you're going in blind sided, they don't tell you what department you're working in; all the way up to you start work trying to know department and all between live chat and calling the ERC they claim to not know your department you'll be in which is a lie they can find out and do know. You're giving one shift and than they randomly change it, never mind if you changed your life around based on the already assigned schedule. They say oh no worries you'll find out when you're there and if a problem they can change it just talk to HR if any problems. But they may just have to change your start date unless they can fit you in on that shift. However, once there they have a very nasty disposition and say well we can Change your department at will based on business needs which is crap. So trying to find every way to mediate the issue where we can all be happy is not in there interests. The company claims to care about their workers but they do not. They attitude was basically this is your shift NOW and department you can't change it until after 90days. Which is also false because they will try any and everything to avoid you from switching departments.

Truth be told that' why it's such a high turn over. They under pay for what they expect to be done.The way they work with picking is not productive rather counterproductive, just horrible. Advice, treat your employees better. If you want all this high demanding work pay more money. The key is work smart not harder, LISTEN to your employees find ways to implement new ideas in still expanding and expediting orders yet in a more logical and functional way for instance either have pickers for each floor or make the picks go in order not jumping from floor one to three next pick common sense you'll tire out much faster. Get more forklifts and provide training from employees already licensed. That will help alleviate issues and make orders go out much faster. At each site there needs to be an actual Human resource room and phone even for managers for proper communication. Finally be mor honest upright and forthcoming with employees on what positions are available or they are being hired for before they accept making them feel taken or trapped tricked. Let them have the option to say okay that position is fine I'll accept. But lying and not willing to resolve problems will always end in a high turnover.

It is hard during busy season to be able to have a work life balance due to the client demands. However, everyone helps out as much as they can so everyone can get the client work done in a timely manner.
","
Just because BDO isn't labeled as Big 4, don't cross them off the list just yet. We are the biggest middle market firm, so yes we have the middle market name, however, we do compete with the Big 4 for clients. I have very large clients and I have very small clients. What I like most about BDO, and what made me choose BDO, was that I was able to choose what I wanted to do and the speed that I wanted to do it in. Many firms would place you in a specific department during your internship based on availability. For the tax department at BDO, we give the interns and new hires a mixture of different return types and industry types and let them choose what path they want to go down. I also wanted to be rewarded for the effort I put in my job. If I worked hard, I wanted to be compensated and promoted (if ready) based on my work ethic. I didn't want to have to get promoted as a group with my intern class. Because of that, I was successfully able to make manager with only 4 years of full time experience. No matter what company you go with, the hours and difficulty will always be comparable. It's the firm with the best culture that you feel you will fit in and what you want out of your career to help make your decision as to where to go. And hopefully that will be here at BDO.","Experienced in TaxDallas, TX2021",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Overall a wonderful experience. I will say one negative now that I think about would be if the need comes up, transferring to another office. My husband was called to serve in a military base in another state, At first I tried to just transfer to the nearest office for BDO but they seemed unwelcoming of the idea and I feel like I wasn't given a real shot of being able to transfer. In the end I didn't really want to leave the office I work for and with COVID, it made it so much easier for me to work for the SLC BDO office from another state. So I'm just so happy I didn't have to start in a new office. It can be hard once you have relationships at your office, but I would like to hope if I do need to transfer in the future, I be taken more seriously.","Entry-level in TaxSalt Lake City, UT2021",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Our firm leadership and regional leadership seem to react as opposed to plan and our outlook is bleak because of it. They keep instituting terrible policies that have wide ranging impacts. They lose all trust with the rank and file (PTO change at the beginning of busy season several years ago). Our decision to chase as many public audits as we could has backfired massively. We picked up clients nobody else would touch and at discounted rates. So we took on additional risk with clients who have terrible control environments and then we are surprised when we fail PCAOB inspections. Our people are overworked and underpaid. Management doesn't actually care. We are told repeatedly to ""just deal with it"" and told ""it will all work out"" which always means, just work your people harder. All in all, this has turned into a fairly toxic place to work from a BDO USA level. It's much better locally, but the tone at the top seems to be ""people first when it works for us and we can make a profit, but profits first and people be damned, when it doesn't""

Visit the office and meet the people. Honestly, that was what swung me in favor of BDO. You'll see a friendliness, and a liveliness that you don't see at other firms. Yes, we work hard here, but overall not nearly as long hours as the Big 4, and you can see it in people's eyes and on their faces. The firm culture is absolutely incredible; Your co-workers will not be people who you never want to see outside of work. I've made some lifelong friends here, and regularly have non-work-sanctioned social events and gatherings among the people of the office.
As for the work, you'll get a great mix of clients, generally having one large job (your main job) where you begin to specialize in an area, and then several smaller jobs to fill in the gaps, where you get to work on multiple areas. You'll often pick up responsibilities beyond your current title, while the people above you truly support/teach you. You'll find yourself a very well-rounded person working here.",,"

This will not work. All this is doing is creating an integration nightmare with a terrible, vicious culture.

BDO at this point in time has struck the perfect balance as an employer and would be a great choice for any qualified candidate considering a position here. The company has a phenomenal reputation and has been experiencing rapid growth through an aggressive business model. BDO is positioned to lead the middle-market and currently provides employees with work experiences rivaling those of the Big 4. BDO's successes and aggressive business model has not compromised the company's dedication to providing BDO employees with a work culture that supports a balanced lifestyle coupled with competitive compensation packages. Additionally, BDO's company size provides an edge over middle-market peers as well as the Big 4 firms for two reasons: (i) BDO's headcount and areas of expertise are vast enough to address the accounting and tax consulting needs of any company; and (ii) BDO is not so large that it cannot nimbly adjust to market changes and individual client requirements.","Mid-level in Employee BenefitsChicago, IL2017",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

There really aren't any really bad aspects if you are truly passionate about working in public accounting. There is a lot of great talent coming up at the manager level which will make getting to partner more challenging but, frankly, getting to partner SHOULD be challenging.

The best way to sum up BDO is our people and clients get Big 4 experience...without the Big 4 experience. We have a focus on early and middle market companies, which provides a very diverse client base and thus many opportunities to learn at a fast pace for all levels within the firm. BDO has a relatively flat structure, which means more decisions are made at the partner level without the need to consult national resources. This reduces bureaucracy and speeds the decision making process, which is appreciated by both our people and our clients. Although public accounting is not a 40 hour per week job, our people do not work long hours all year and are not expected to. We make every attempt to schedule our jobs properly and encourage everyone to make time for themselves. In our Tysons, VA location, we have built out a state of the art facility tat encourages teamwork and personal interaction.

The firm does have a great group of people, which originally persuaded me to take the position at BDO but there is also a lot of drama and unprofessional things that occur. The behaviors are unbelievable, especially in a professional setting. Also, BDO does a great job with the open door policy but a lot of the times what is said behind those doors does not stay confidential and it seems that even if you address a matter with management regarding preferences or anything they don't really care. The favorite game is also played a lot at the firm and very political. The workload at BDO is normal for public accounting but you are also given a lot more work due to other people not doing their jobs. Since you have deadlines you must pick up other people's slack which is very frustrating. Also, regarding the work/life balance, it is basically non-existent, management is very pushy about working billable hours if not more than what you are scheduled.","Entry-level in Audit & AssuranceDetroit, MI2016",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

I believe overall, BDO has the makings of being a great firm. However, some of the current policies would need to be improved. Compensation for candidates coming out of college is fairly close to that of other firms. With that said, depending on the situation, it can be very difficult to be promoted and thus, compensation can suffer for the amount of experience on the job. The work/life balance at BDO is solid - better than many other accounting firms. BDO is one of the fastest growth firms and it appears likely to continue for the foreseeable future.","Entry-level in TaxGrand Rapids, MI2015",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Public accounting is public accounting. Busy season is busy season. Expect to work anywhere from 8:30-8/9/10 on certain engagements plus Saturdays when during busy season or other crunch times. The firm is more laid back and down to earth than a Big 4 and still offers a great deal of prestige for those who want to use it as a springboard to a different career. The firm is growing, has some cool clients, and is committed to improving itself as much as possible. Compensation lacks a bit in comparison to Big 4 and there is no OT, but for a first job you could do a lot worse than learning how to audit at the 5th largest firm. Quality of life will suffer.

I expect workload to be relatively manageable compared to other accounting firms; the general consensus is that new staff like myself work only about 50 hours a week, sometimes maybe 60, during busy season. Our compensation is about the same as that at the Big 4, but you put in fewer hours to get it. At BDO, you also gain exposure to a wide range of audit areas, even at the staff level; you don't get stuck auditing the same area over and over again.

LEK is incredible. There is a lot of detail on some websites about it being a sweatshop, or that people get ""thrown in"" without proper training. I think that's the furthest thing from the truth. Hours at LEK aren't any worse than any other Consulting shop, and if on some weeks they are, its marginal. Moreover, our weekends are highly protected due to the commitment of senior leadership.

One of the knocks on L.E.K. on campus is that it doesn't have the same brand recognition of some of the other firms. Part of that is just a matter of scale and frankly if you are at all interested in making a career out of consulting, I'd argue L.E.K.'s relative scale is actually an advantage (i.e., big enough to be a truly global firm that competes for big strategy work yet small enough that there are ample growth opportunities and paths to Partner within the firm.)","Partner in StrategyBoston, MA2018",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

LEK provides the most management responsibility to post-MBA Consultants relative to other strategy firms. Consultants are expected to manage complex team analyses / synthesis / output from day one and are held to an extremely high standard. Consultants will attain a disciplined approach to problem solving through Corporate Strategy and M&A Strategy engagements that will be applicable to many future endeavors.
As such, Consultants leaving LEK are viewed as having a refined managerial / analytical skillset and are coveted by top tier corporate development and internal strategy departments.","Midlevel in StrategyLos Angeles, CA2018",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

That being said, many people leave after ~2 years given the long hours (rarely any weekend work though!) and difficult work/life balance.

Its strong quantitative and analytical capabilities provide a well-rounded experience that allows the firm to derive more substantive and data-rich recommendations. L.E.K. also has a noteworthy private equity focus across a broad range of industries. L.E.K.'s business school placement is superb, placing candidates in the top business schools. The firm provides great exit opportunities with many transitioning to startups, finance positions, PE firms, and industry.

Furthermore, the learning experience at L.E.K. is tremendous as you get exposed to both primary research and data analysis/market modelling relatively quickly. Finally, while the hours can be difficult at times, this is counterbalanced by very little travel and very little working from home or weekend work.","Chicago, IL2013",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

* L.E.K. is a non-travel, office based culture that promotes stronger relationships with peers within the firm and a better work-life balance.
* L.E.K.'s focus on pure strategy work is a significant plus for candidates seeking to work on the most challenging, most important business problems.
* Due to L.E.K's focus on pure strategy work, cases are typically shorter than at other firms (~5 weeks on average). This means that the candidate will experience ~10 cases each year. This rapid-pace of projects accelerates the employee's learning as they work with more teams, learn how to solve more business problems, for more companies, and in more industries.
* L.E.K's typical team structure involves more bachelor-level associates on each team than M.B.A.'s, which means for bachelor-level candidates that more complex, challenging work is passed down to the bachelor level. Furthermore, for the M.B.A. candidate, it means that they are immediately in a role supervising the work of bachelor-level associates. This means that the M.B.A. candidate is able to focus more time on solving the higher-level business problems and immediately begins developing management experience.",,,"Chicago, IL2012",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Another great and unique aspect of Kenway’s is the entrepreneurial spirit of the employees and the leadership opportunities afforded. One review mentioned that 60% of employees were on the leadership team. That number is actually 25% or 14 employees. The majority of those employees are not spending all of their time on leadership activities, some only spend 5-10 hours a week. This approach helps a broader set of people provide their valuable leadership skills, be challenged, build the business and embody entrepreneurial spirt. I personally love this approach as it keeps me challenged and motivated.

There is no shortage of work, which is great for business.
","
Company does not hire enough people for the workload they need done.
During training, managers would brag about how the company charges among the highest rates in the Bay Area for their work, yet they pay associates at the bottom barely over $60,000, which just isn’t a good look.
A few of the partners genuinely do seem to care about lower level employees, but it’s luck of the draw and some of the partners are not as down to earth and don’t seem to care that much about lower level employees.
Long hours were discussed in the hiring process, however mandatory weekends for 4 months out of the year (a significant chunk of the year) were not mentioned at all during the hiring process— something which some would consider deceptive hiring practice.
401k match here is not impressive.
Company seems to shell out a large amount of money for the company party every year, but doesn’t seem to be willing to share that much of the company profit with lower level employees.

The clients you get to work on are extremely interesting. Being one of the top accounting firms in the Silicon Valley, you will be able to work with some extremely interesting clients. The work/life balance is good, compensation is just as good as Big 4 and other big firms. The firm is constantly growing and is always looking for ways to grow even more.

If you're interested in becoming an accountant and working directly in the tax department, you're king here. If you work in any other department, you bow down to tax for the most part, especially if you're hired as a staff person or in the Service to the Firm department.
The workload is intense during busy seasons but manageable for the rest of the time (unless you're in Family Office and then it's always busy). As an associate, you get paid a LOT, especially for an entry level position and you have a clear path to moving up in your department, packed with large raises yearly. Everyone's generally really nice and friendly, and there's a huge population of young people. If you're hired as a first year associate, you'll be coming in with at least 20 other people in you're same spot, so it's easy to make friends.
If you get hired as a staff or service person, your time at the firm will be a lot different. If you're not in tax, you have fewer opportunities or advantages to move up or succeed and you don't get praised as much or get invited to as many parties.",,,"Palo Alto, CA2016",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Having to have relocated 800+ miles to be here, but it was worth it

I was a musical theatre geek in high school and a generalist-extraordinaire as I graduated Valedictorian. I wanted to pursue a business degree in order to provide a more stable future for myself and felt it was the best application of the skill set I possessed at the time. One of the first classes I had to take was accounting, and after being told it was the language of business, I felt it would be the best foundation I could set for myself. The general inclination is to go for a ""Big-4"" public accounting position. But I found that with smaller, regional/local firms, the development and inclusiveness within the firm is unparalleled. You have greater access to superiors, there is more emphasis on supporting a good work-life balance, and the range of work experience exposure is far greater. I would trade the ""Big-4"" name on my resume for these aspects any day because, not only are they going to give me the stability I craved, they are going to make me into a better person.","Entry-level in TaxPalo Alto, CA2015",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Before I left for business school I worked on 45 projects over 4 years from a 1 week diligence to a 6 month strategy project. My colleagues at competing firms had worked on 3-6 projects in the same 4 years. The amount of experience that you receive at EY-Parthenon is incredible because of the strategy focus and shorter projects.
Traveling for work sounds fun and exciting, but trust me it gets old quickly. EY-Parthenon is unique in the management consulting industry with its limited travel - this is a huge benefit. Many of my friends from business school who went to work at competing firms left within the first 2 years due to the travel requirements. I love consulting, but I would not still be doing this job 10 years later if I had to travel 4 days per week.
Majority fixed compensation is especially important in today's environment with a likely recession in the next 2-3 years. In a recession your total comp at EY-Parthenon won't significantly decline.

Parthenon-EY provides an unparalleled opportunity to develop professional skills in strategy consulting, which comes at the cost of work-life balance. No matter how good a company's training programs are, the vast majority of what you learn happens on the job. Parthenon is extremely efficient and expects you to catch up to a very high standard of professional skills immediately. For 1.5 years, you're climbing a very high skills ladder and they constantly keep you on your toes with double staffing and stretch opportunities. After those 1.5 years, you are up for promotion and you start at the bottom of a fairly new skills curve. The downside is that this can be stressful and involves a lot of work hours.","Midlevel in StrategyChicago, IL2018",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Candidates should really invest in learning more about the exact work different consulting firms do. There is a big difference between one-month diligence cases and six-month implementation projects. It's really a matter of preference, but candidates shouldn't be surprised when they show up on the job.
Candidates should also think about whether these are people that they can see themselves working with and having fun with day-in and day-out. The work is pretty similar at many consulting firms (it's a lot of Excel and PowerPoint), but the people are different. Go somewhere that you'll be happy and have fun.

1) Staffing process: Anyone below Manager level is on their own to find their next project after one ends. Despite of doing multiple projects successfully, once you roll-off from a project, you have to start looking for your next gig.
2) Cheap: On one hand the firm wants to develop IP but has close to zero budget. The S&O practice has lost all of its subscriptions for basic market research reports. Most partners are wine & dine and golf type of sales people instead of intellectuals that want to come up with new methodologies. Exceptions are partners that came from Mckinsey, BCG or ATK.
3) Cost leader: Routinely partners win projects by undercutting competitors and understaffing projects. Everyday low prices.
4) Exit opportunities and alumni program: Firm provides zero help to find jobs for people who want to leave for personal reasons. Likewise, the alumni program is no where comparable to MBBs. Basically you are on your own to get staffed and you are on your own to find an outside job if you don't want to do consulting.
5) Knowledge management: Consultants do not share prior knowledge or documents in fear of someone else using and not giving credit. No way to systematically search if prior knowledge on a topic exists unless you start emailing people .
6) Compensation not in line with other companies: For fresh MBAs, the company is competitive. Once you are in, the salary increase is barely 5% a year. After 3-4 years, there is a big gap between what you would make vs. someone at MBB.

No work-life balance. Unreasonable requirements for on-site work even though there's no seats for anyone, parking comes out of your own pocket, and the office locations are in hot spots where traffic converges and parking costs are very high. Beyond billable targets, there are ""firm contribution"" metrics and a culture of unhealthy competition for promotions that drive people to working around the clock to stay a step ahead of the next dog. Senior Managers and above duck and cover delegating all accountability onto Manager and below. Partners, principals and directors milk their relationships to capture projects, and then express frustration when the delivery team needs their time to support the launch - why can't we just navigate the terms of the proposal and read their minds? Can't we all see how busy they all are? (golf, lunch, spa). Exorbitant bill rates price Deloitte out of most compelling business and government challenges. Discounted bill rates result in grossly understaffed execution teams - 5 people doing the work that was proposed for 15. I don't know how Deloitte ascended to #4 on this list... but I'm sure it cost them a pretty penny to skirt the Glass Door data. Even in Federal, they had an unreasonable policy against hiring anyone without a Bachelor's degree - even those who were former honorable military with combat service, even when those people had Associates degree. They made these people join the firm on a separate Associate track where the raises and promotions were different and the terms of the employment related only to the one specific project for which they were hired. Project ends, you're out of Deloitte.

Compensation is low vis-a-vis comparable firms. The firm benchmarks its pay against the Big4.

You can also get pigeon-holed in a less interesting project/role and it's hard to break out of it (especially if you do a good job and the manager never wants you to leave). Your staffing preferences is probably last on the list of considerations, with your utilization % & billable rates being the first.

Fatigue -- High performance culture mean a relentless pursuit of growth and a focus on operational excellence
","
As a lateral hire to Deloitte and former partner with another large consulting firm, I believe Deloitte is best suited if (1) you are looking for a low-ego, collegial style and culture that fosters taking the long-view of both the market and client - and who know the attributes of what makes a hyper-successful team; (2) you want to intentially avoid a star-driven, mercenary culture - Deloitte is highly performance-driven, but not a kill what you eat culture -- sustainable performance over time and selfless behavoir for clients and our people are rewarded -- no, prized; (2) you are a professional with a strong sense of self (self-directed and self-development focused) and tend to be happiest when organizational boundries are low and tribal bonds are even lower. You know a the keys to success is not jockeying in an organization -- but in fostering innovative work relationships, connecting with suitable mentors across the organization, and building go-to-market networks -- these are keys to success; (3) you are impact-focused, not effort-focused. Our strategy is centered on client issue-to-impact.","Arlington, VA2014",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

There are 2 major things that set Deloitte apart from other firms in the industry that are imprtant to consider when choosing a place of employment.

In addition, Deloitte's leadership is committed to letting you know exactly what they expect of you. Thus if you think you can be promoted in two years, you will know from conversations with leadership what you need to do to get there and if its feasible well in advance. This allows you to plan for the future, helps you meet realistic yet challenging goals, and helps you to take risks that you may not otherwise take because you know you have a support system to help you.","Arlington, VA2012",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Public accounting at Big 4 can have higher demands that in industry or smaller firms.
","
I think the key is to decide your long term goal first - if you want to be in financial/tax senior leadership (whether in public accounting or in industry), then you should target Big 4 accounting and stay there as long as possible. In decided which of the Big 4, I believe the culture and people are critical because you need to like who you are working with. I chose Deloitte because of the people. Another key point is that Deloitte offers something unique that the other Big 4 do not offer, and that is the ability to work at a Big 4 firm that has a Consulting function. This opens up new doors, opportunities, and learning experiences that the other firms do not have because they don't have a Consulting function.","Partner/Principal in TaxTampa, FL2021",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Advice to Candidates
This firm has incredible opportunities, which comes with a lot of hard work. Make sure to advocate for yourself - if you are stressed/overwhelmed/working too much - talk to someone. If you are not working on things that interest you, or want to get involved in something - talk to someone. There are so many opportunities, you can make the job what you want it to be.
Also, attitude is everything. Not saying you have to be positive all the time, because anyone who has been in public accounting knows that's not possible, and a good vent session is therapeutic, but the more positive you are the happier you will be.",,"

I can't stress what a great employer Deloitte has been. Twice in my career, the firm has really stepped in. Once when I was a young manager, we had a tree fall through our house. The partner in charge of the group was at my house that day - ensuring we had a place to stay-offering for us to stay at his house) Once we re-built, his wife surprised us by decorating our kid's room (we were expecting our second at that point). Recently, I had a health issue - again, the firm stepped in and took care of me and my family - I think both of these circumstances demonstrate how the firm treats its people.","Partner/Principal in TaxBoston, MA2019",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

This is a big differentiator for me personally. The quality of people here is excellent and I think people all over this industry recognize that.
","
I think that many times people at all levels are sort of self- rather than team-focused. There are definitely exceptions, but I think that the firm loses a lot from people trying to make their own name rather than build teaming relationships where people at the firm can grow together. This also goes to client relationships - I have seen in multiple occasions where the solutions that make us look the best get chosen over the best solutions for the client. If I was the sole owner of the firm I would never allow this to happen and I would let everyone know. The firm - and individuals - often rely heavily on reputation. However, I think we could be doing more to actually build value rather than merely try to be seen as the ones building value. This culture also bleeds into team dynamics, which is ultimately what tends to drive employee satisfaction, retention and finally the firm's job performance. I think that our firm should be doing more to be judged purely on our merits, particularly at the small-team level. This will encourage the true stars to rise to the top, discourage scapegoating and backstabbing and encourage innovation.
","
Benefits are generally excellent, and the firm has been making meaningful strides to make sure you have time off and feel like you can handle your own life where you need to. There are a lot of bureaucratic issues you will need to navigate, but people who not only work hard/smart but ones who are experienced in navigating their career are the ones who will really grow here. The firm will not fight to grow your compensation substantially (even if you are a top performer) to the extent of what you are worth in the market if you don't have leadership fighting for you. Making meaningful contributions is critical of course, but making sure partners vouch for you is one of the biggest things you can do for your career here... unfortunately.","Mid-level in ConsultingArlington, VA2017",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Deloitte is a great place to launch your career because of the investment the Firm makes into training our professionals and the people you'll meet along the way. No other firm has a dedicated state of the art training facility besides Deloitte (Deloitte University). In addition, there are few places where you have the opportunity to work on Fortune 500 companies and how many Companies would give someone the opportunity to participate in meetings with executives of those Fortune 500 companies within a couple years out of college? The networking opportunities are incredible (both within the firm and outside of the firm).

I understand the need for utilization metrics... however, each client situation is different and Deloitte needs to take those situations into consideration. For example, I'm on a federal engagement with capped hours (and the clearance level required makes it impossible to work on client work at home) which makes it very hard to meet utilization metrics and take all of the PTO allotted to us.","Mid-level in Financial Accounts & ReportingArlington, VA2017",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Deloitte is a great employee in a great profession. The profession has its flaws, as does any, but the firm is largely the product of the profession, not the other way around. Deloitte, by every standard, is doing what it can to change the status quo by providing more flexibility, and opportunities for work-life fit that is custom tailored to each employee and his/her needs. Accept that pay will be less in public accounting that in industry -- at least early on -- but also understand that the learning and growth opportunities in industry will pale by comparison to what can be obtained in public accounting. It has never been the name, pay, or prestige that has kept me at Deloitte. It has always been the people I have the opportunity to work with, mentor, and lead.

My advice to all candidates trying to decide between firms is to base it on the culture of the firm/office you are wanting to work at. The culture in the Miami office is likely going to be very different than the culture in the Tampa office.

Being in Tampa, I would not want to work at the other Big 4 offices in Tampa. However, I cannot say the same thing would be true in a different city.

Salary is not competitive - would make far more money working elsewhere.

It has a great reputation, there is good job security, and if you work hard to do well your performance is recognized (with awards, bonuses, raises, etc).

I just completed a seven-week internal inspection which seems to be something that could have been done in 2 weeks but we are so scared of our regulators at this point that we are doing more damage internally than good.

Overall, I think that Deloitte is the best choice (for tax, at least) when it comes to Big 4 accounting firms. They give great training through their new Deloitte University near Dallas (really nice facility); have better perks and PTO allowances than other big firms; and in my opinion, are winning in the market. I think the long hours and working under pressure is inherent in public accounting (especially in big firms).

It is really depressing to watch the client walk out hours before you do knowing you still have to go home and work, and you might still get chewed out by some manager who showed up for two hours that day and went to bed at a decent hour...and won't care about your work until the end of the project when it's too late to do constructive criticism.

From the beginning know that there will be long hours, especially during the ""busy season"" period. You will be expected to put in hours on Saturday's during this period from mid-January until end of April. You may end up on jobs that are also busy during the summer and require long hours around that time to. Managing your time is key. Communicating is important, not only regarding work but regarding your personal needs. It is ok to set boundaries from the start to avoid getting take advantage of and becoming overworked. Once you get past this the work is great, you get to interact with clients and have good/bad interactions. Look for a team that will stand behind you no matter what. I personally have worked with great teams. Workload can be a lot but if you communicate what you realistically can and cannot accomplish you will avoid setting false expectations. Working with the teams is great, the firm provides a lot of great benefits and tries to provide events outside of the professional setting. Compensation is good and increases yearly based on performance.","Mid-level in Audit & AssuranceLos Angeles, CA2021",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

At RSM, you will be able to work on a variety of different clients, projects, and teams. The variety provides invaluable learning experiences that will help you progress in your career quickly. With clients, I've been able to work on clients that are household names as well as mom & pop local shops.

Its a bunch of little firms cobbled together into one big firm, and there are a LOT of redundancies and inefficiencies. There's a huge amount of bureaucracy and focus on cramming every client and every employee into a standard little square box, even when its actively harmful to client relationships, to efficiency, to common sense.
","
I think overall you'll find this firm more and more like a Big 4 firm. There's a really heavy focus on meeting internal metrics, and to push clients into the firm's chosen internally-developed platforms and processes. When these work well, its a win for all. But many of these do not work well, are difficult to use, cumbersome to set-up, and make clients feel like they're being asked to do more work to make themselves fit in these narrowly-defined boxes, without any ability to have the firm adapt to meet what the client wants/needs. You'll get good experience, and can access lots of self-directed training to broaden your horizon. The work-life balance and quality of life is probably marginally better here than at a Big 4 firm, but its not a huge difference. The benefits aren't great overall, but I think they're in line with what large firms off in general, and there are fewer and fewer smaller/medium firms left to choose from.

I believe this is a good firm for those looking to work in public accounting and in a larger firm. Larger firms have great resources, training, and strategies for staying relevant in a face-paced changing time period. However, public accounting is very demanding. Then with this firms strategy to stay relevant and working with clients who deal in a faced paced time period, the expectation to be available for extra hours beyond busy season and fall busy season continues to increase. There is a lot of opportunity for career growth in many different directions, high compensation, and options for work/life balance. However, work/life balance can be very hard to achieve and often for advancement, putting in a lot of extra work/time is required.","Experienced in TaxWilmington, NC2020",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

I think RSM is a great example of a mid-market company that allows you to be exposed to lots of clients early on, rather than large clients for long periods of time. You learn more when you are exposed to more and you get more learning opportunities when you have many small clients throughout the year.

Longer fall busy season than most other CPA firms in the area, working 25-30 Saturdays per year. Very high value of billable hours and margin. The only thing the firms cares about is that you make the partners money. Partners let people work until 3:00am and just decide to ""look the other way.""
","
If you work for RSM you will get a lot of experience and knowledge. The downfall of gaining this experience and knowledge so fast is that you have to work TWO BUSY SEASONS per year (spring and fall) instead of one traditional busy season like they tell you in college. You will also work on average 25 Saturdays per year so get ready to start telling your friends ""NO"" when they call you on Fridays. Working for RSM will take up a large majority of your time and if you don't already have a good support group you will struggle to maintain a social life.

Speaking from my experience in the Peoria office for 5 years, I have found that RSM is committed to promoting a work/life balance, and in general the firm seems highly concerned with ensuring its employees are happy. Its vacation time and parenting leave is very generous, as is its compensation. The firm is also attentive to the needs of its individual employees with respect to various preferences, such as travel, client industry focus, etc. I personally do not travel as much as many of my colleagues (I travel approximately 7-8 weeks a year), and this is in large part due to the firm accommodating my request to keep travel to a minimum and keep it as close to home as possible (so I can be home with my wife and small children). I have heard leaders in Central Illinois mention many times that they want employees to speak up if there is anything causing them to dislike any aspect of their jobs (travel, working with certain people, working on certain clients, etc.); the leaders want to make sure any problems are brought up and addressed so that changes can be made to make sure employees are as satisfied with their jobs as possible.","Other in Audit & AssurancePeoria, IL2018",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Obviously there are some things, no matter which firm you choose to work for, that are difficult about accounting (i.e. busy season's long hours), but as long as you're not afraid to ask questions, I guarantee that you will learn more with RSM than with most other firms where I've heard stories of just getting assigned a bunch of work and being told to figure it out. That has never happened to me and at RSM, no matter if it takes 5 minutes or 5 hours, there's a high likelihood that someone will take the time to explain anything you have questions on as everyone here truly wants to see you grow in your career and learn as much as possible.","Mid-level in Audit & AssuranceNew Haven, CT2018",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

We work very hard to serve our clients and the fees we charge are not adequate. Often we will propose on a company, get in to the audit and realize there were items we weren't aware of during the proposal that require more work. Rather than bill for this we eat the cost in order to save the client. Then we're trapped in this bad fee for years and it takes us a long time to make the money we deserve on a client.

If you're going into public accounting you should already know that the workload is tough and time consuming for all public accounting firms, not just RSM. But something that differentiates RSM from the 'Big 4' is that you'll gain the public accounting experience of a big firm (we have both national and international reach) without the big firm life. RSM typically has smaller clients, so you get to be a part of more engagements and see different industries. This also allows staff to work on more sections than just cash and accounts payable in their first year here. Staff are also working directly with the controller or CFO of these companies, so you get client contact with upper level management.","Mid-level in Audit & AssuranceKansas City, MO2018",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

I believe the key to succeeding in public accounting is knowing what you're getting yourself into. Jobs in public accounting are demanding, but they can also be rewarding.

If a person is aware of the hours and expectations during the interview process, they're better equipped to make an informed decision if this is the right place for them.

At RSM, you truly get exposed to a variety of clients and accounting issues. You get to see an entire audit file, assist with the audit report as an associate, and get face time with the client. You'll have a lot of responsibilities, which can be overwhelming at first, but the people here want you to succeed and provide you with the tools to do so. If you have an interview with us, we've likely determined that you're smart enough for the job, and now we want to evaluate whether we can sit in a conference room with you for 12 hours and whether we can confidently put you in front of the client without worrying about ruining a relationship.","Dallas, TX2018",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Office to office the culture is very different, so I can only speak for my office. First off, have a good attitude and be positive about the assignments you get and the clients you work on. You'll be with your audit teams for weeks at a time, and it's much easier to be with a cheerful person rather than a grump. Also, I've found it helps to take ownership of things instead of blaming others. If I'm in-charging an engagement and something goes wrong, I take responsibility for it, whether it's directly my fault or now. I explain what happened and what I'm going to do to fix it. Same thing for staff. Take ownership of your assigned work. I look at my job as I should be making life easier for the people above me, the people below me, and especially my clients. Take the approach of earning your position every day and you'll go far. I see so many people who show up and just hang out because they have no drive. Have some drive and just try a little bit and that'll take you so far.","Mid-level in Audit & AssuranceGreensboro, NC2018",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

Very frankly, I believe there is no qualify of life working in big accounting firms including my employer. To be able to survive and succeed, you have to work whatever it takes including very long hours close to big due dates to get the job done well. You have to always prepare to self-taught as other colleagues or training can only help so much. Always depend on yourself to stay on top of everything. If someone want a 9-5 job there is no such easy job in big accounting firms, may be in smaller accounting firms but I don't know which ones.

Work-life balance is promoted but not realistic once you are at the in-charge and above levels. Full-time employees discuss taking a reduced work schedule with a cut in pay, just to actually work full-time instead of time-and-a-half. But instead, they usually just end up leaving for more pay AND better work-life balance.
Leadership also isn't realistic when it comes to budgeting client work. They forget how much time is actually takes to complete a task, not to mention if the client messed something up and we have to fix it. You're damned if you do, because now you're blowing the budget, you're damned if you don't because now the client's records are wrong.

RSM is a ""just right"" balance between the prestige and scale of a big firm with the versatility of a smaller firm. You might occasionally work 70 hours a week, but you won't work 100. You'll work with a wide array of clients in all different sizes and industries - both small and large - rather than being placed on a 24/7 engagement team for a single mega-client.
In my view, perhaps the most appealing thing about RSM is that its combination of size (lots of available capital) and growth potential (lots of reason to reinvest that capital) allows it to constantly evolve its technology platforms and its business processes. That means our technology is all very up to date and we're constantly trying new things to improve the efficiency of the business, because the firm can afford (and perhaps can't afford not) to take the risk of making new investments.","Mid-level in TaxRaleigh, NC2017",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

In any accounting firm, your experience is subject to a number of factors, including the effort you put in, the type of clients are you assigned, the quality of the clients you are assigned to, and the firm itself. Assuming candidates are willing to put in the time and effort to learn and interact with their clients and really become invested in them, the factors such as difficult clients are common across the public accounting industry. From my experience, I have found that with regarding to McGladrey as a firm, the differentiator is the people I have worked for who take an interest in my and my goals and my career aspirations.

Generally students out of college have no idea what public accounting is all about. They don't understand the amount of stress, hours and travel that this job requires. Don't get me wrong, there are definitely benefits to public accounting such as compensation, flexiblity in hours (not so much in the first couple of years, but definitely when you reach the manager level), learning opportunities, leadership development including learning to manage people, manage time, etc. / / I see those that enter public accounting as choosing one of two ultimate career paths: / / 1) Partner Track - some people that start in public know they want to advance their career in public all the way to the partner level. Others develop that aspiration after a few years. You must have the proper skill set, some of which can be learned while the rest is just part of your personality. You have to be able to get out in the marketplace and get clients. This involves a lot of networking. / / 2) Building Block - I would say most of my peers are on this path. These people do not have the desire to ever be a partner whether its due to the significant responsibility placed on them to guide the firm, ensure compliance with firm and industry standards, the money or capital contribution required or the networking and business development requirements. These types of people are in public accounting simply to gain experience. Public accounting definitely gives you an edge over your peers that jump straight into private industry. Not only are you more advanced technically, but you have developed valuable soft skills such as people management, time management, etc. This makes you a much more well rounded accountant and makes you very desirable for the private industry. The challenge if you see yourself going on this path is when to leave public accounting and for what type of opportunity. / / Public accounting requires not only brains, but the proper personality. You will succeed in public accounting if you are organized, a quick learner, enjoys a past faced environment, can handle stress well and can manage your time well, etc. You won't be expected to know everything there is about accounting, but you will be expected to quickly learn it and when you don't know the answer, speak up or know where to go find the answer. Even when you don't think you've completely mastered a topic, you will be challenged by something new. / / My firm is not much different than any of our competitors. I think the technical and career opportunities including compensation are relatively identical. The biggest difference will be the culture. When participating in the recruiting process, keep in mind that you are not only being interviewed by them, but you are intervieiwng them. You must spend the time and meet as many people as you can to get a good sense of what the culture is at each firm you're interested in. Spending time talking with them, visiting the office, etc will give you a good glimpse and will help you determine whether you fit that culture or not. When you get as far into the recruting process as getting offers, don't focus only on the monetary compensation (pay, bonus, benefits, etc). Think about the other aspects of the firm, the culture.","Tacoma, WA2013",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE

I think McGladrey is only going to grow and improve its image in the marketplace. While the Big Four are all solid companies, they are so large it doesn't seem like they have anywhere new to go. I would rather be with McGladrey because there always seems to be a new venture or opportunity, and I've never felt pigeonholed into working on the same client or the same industry all of the time. I get diverse experience and learning opportunities. And if you are a good, hard worker and you put yourself out there, management won't ignore you if you request to be part of something that interests you.

Public accounting and our firm is a tremendous place to work if a person appreciates learning something new everyday. Being willing and able to adapt to busy season and maintaining a positive attitude can open many doors. While a flexible schedule is something that can be earned over the years, individuals new to public accounting need to be aware that this is not a typical 8 - 5 job.

Lack of communication and engagment from partners at the local office - they tend to talk to mid-level managers and rarely interact with staff below manager. As a result - they are disconnected from the needs, wants, and aspirations of this important employee group.

Business outlook is strong and one would assume that advancement opportunity will follow. Turn-over at the manager and above level is very low. While this can be considered a positive that people at the manager and above level are mostly satisfied with their position, the speed with which people at those levels are advancing is relatively slow and poses advancement issues for those who have not made manager but have 5+ years of experience.","Raleigh, NC2013",VERIFIED EMPLOYEE
